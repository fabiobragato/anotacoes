- Github Actions:

	• A workflow automation service by Github
	• Automate all kinds of repository-related processes & actions:
		1. Code Deploymnet (CI/CD):
			~ Automate code testing, building & deployment
			~ CI = Continuous Integration (code changes are automatically built, tested & merged with existing code)
			~ CD = Continuous Delivery (after integration, new app or package versions are published automatically)
			
		2. Code & Repository Management:
			~ Automate code reviews, issue management etc.
			
- Git:

	• Is a free version control system
	• Manage source code changes
	• Save code snapshots ("commits")
	• Work with alternative code versions ("branches")
	• Move between branches & commits ("checkout")
	
- GitHub:

	• A cloud git repository & services provider
	
- Git basics:

	• "git init" only required once per project
	• "git add" stage changes for next commit
	• "git commit" create a commit that includes all staged changes
	• "git status" gives some information about staged changes
	• "git commit -m "message here"" creates a snapshot (commit)
	• "git log" to see all commits:
		~ HEAD tell us which snapshot our code is loaded
	• press "q" to leave the "git log"
	• "git checkout <id>" to switch between commits
	• "git checkout main" to return to the last commit
	• "git revert <id>" to revert changes of commit by creating a new commit
	• "git add ." to include all files in all subfolders
	
- Understanding branches:

	• "git branch <name>" to create a new branch
	• By default, this command ahead takes the currently commit target by head and builds a new branch using this commit as the starting point
	• "git branch" to list all branches
	• "git checkout <branch-name>" to change between branchs
	• "git branch -D <branch-name>" to delete a branch
	• "git checkout -b <branch-name>" to create a branch and automatically move to it
	• "git merge <branch-name>" to automatically merge branches

- Working with GitHub:
	• "git remote add origin <link>" to add your remote code
	• "git push -u origin main" to your first connection 
	• "git push" for updating files in GitHub
